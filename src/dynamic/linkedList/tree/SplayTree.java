 * Splay Tree is a nearly balanced Binary Search Tree.
 * A splay tree is a self-adjusting BST with the additional property that recently accessed 
 * elements are quick to access again. It performs basic operations such as insertion, look-up and removal in 
 * O(log n) amortized time. For many sequences of non-random operations, splay trees perform better than other 
 * search trees, even when the specific pattern of the sequence is unknown.
