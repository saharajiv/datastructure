# datastructure
This project contains the implementation of different data structures as well as algorithms related to them. It also contains uses of different datastructures in different problem scenarios.

The following data-structure implementation have been added in the project:
1. Stack
2. Queue
3. LinkedList
4. Doubly linked List
5. Circular Linked List
6. Binary Search Tree
7. Graph
